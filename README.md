# Smart Home Automation System using IoT

Welcome to my Smart Home Automation System project repository! This project leverages the power of IoT to create an intelligent and interconnected living environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. **Arduino IDE**: Download and install the latest version of Arduino IDE from the official website [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. **ESP8266 Board Support**: Our project utilizes the ESP8266 microcontroller. Follow the steps below to install the ESP8266 board in your Arduino IDE.

### Installing ESP8266 Board Support

1. Open your Arduino IDE.

2. Go to `File` -> `Preferences`.

3. In the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field, add the following URL: http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
   
4. Click `OK` to close the Preferences window.

5. Navigate to `Tools` -> `Board` -> `Boards Manager...`

6. In the Boards Manager, type `esp8266` into the search bar.

7. Click on `esp8266` by ESP8266 Community and click the `Install` button.

8. Once the installation is complete, close the Boards Manager.

Now, you're all set up to work on our Smart Home Automation System project!
